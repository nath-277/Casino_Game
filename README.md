## Getting Started

To get started with the game, you'll need a C++ compiler. Follow these steps to compile and run the game:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/nath-277/Casino_Game.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```sh
    cd Casino_Game
    ```

3. **Compile the game:**
    ```sh
    g++ -o Casino_game Casino_Game.cpp
    ```

4. **Run the game:**
    ```sh
    ./Casino_Game
    ```

## How to Play

1. **Introduction:**
    - The game starts with an introduction screen, made by "BLACK-KING".
    - Players are asked if they are ready to start. Type `Y` to start or `N` to quit.

2. **Gameplay:**
    - The game explains the rules, and you start by pressing Enter.
    - You have an initial wallet balance of $15.
    - Choose a difficulty mode:
        - Easy: Costs $1, guess a number between 1 and 10.
        - Medium: Costs $5, guess a number between 1 and 50.
        - Hard: Costs $10, guess a number between 1 and 100.
    - After choosing a difficulty, you make a guess. If you guess correctly, you win the amount corresponding to the difficulty. If you guess wrong, you lose the corresponding amount.
    - You can play as long as you have enough balance in your wallet.
    - If your balance falls below the required amount for the chosen difficulty, the game will display a message to fund your account.

3. **End of Game:**
    - The game ends when you choose not to play again or when your wallet balance is insufficient to continue playing.

## Game Features

- **Difficulty Modes:**
    - Three difficulty modes with varying cost and range of numbers.
- **Wallet Balance:**
    - Keeps track of your virtual money and updates after each game round.
- **Random Number Generation:**
    - Uses `rand()` and `srand()` for generating random numbers for the computer's guess.
